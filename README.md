# Shopping-list

This repository contains my implementation of the "Shopping-list" mini-project, part of my learning journey in JavaScript on Udemy with Professor Brad Traversy. The project focuses on applying fundamental JavaScript concepts to create a simple and interactive shopping list application.

## Project Features:
. Add Items: Easily add items to your shopping list.\n
. Remove Items: Remove items from the list with a single click.
. Mark as Completed: Mark items as completed when you've purchased them.
. Persistent Data: The shopping list data is stored locally, ensuring your list is available even after a page refresh.

## Technologies Used:
. JavaScript: Applied core JavaScript concepts for functionality.
. HTML & CSS: Basic structure and styling to enhance the user interface.
. LocalStorage: Utilized localStorage for persistent data storage.

## How to Use:
1-Clone the repository to your local machine.
2-Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
3-Interact with the shopping list to add, remove, and mark items as completed.

## Learning Objectives:
. Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript in a real-world project.
. Understand the principles of DOM manipulation for interactive web applications.
. Practice coding standards and best practices as recommended by Professor Brad Traversy.
